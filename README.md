Title: Eigenvalue Calculator
Functionality
1.	The program will ask the user to enter a matrix.
2.	Determinant of the matrix will be calculated using the formula: |A| = a d – b c
3.	Eigenvalue will be calculated using the logic and displayed as the output.
4.	Eigenvector will be calculated using the logic and displayed as the output.

Additional Details
1.	The project will be implemented in java.
2.	NetBeans IDE and a compatible jdk version will be installed on the laptop/PC for creating the project.
3.	The project does not require any extra software tool or built-in library.
4.	The logic of the program will be created and implemented using pure java language.
5.	The user will be allowed to calculate the determinant, eigenvalue, and eigenvector separately to improve the program’s usability.
6.	Different functions will be created for calculating values and matrices to avoid any confusion.
7.	Connection with a database is not required because no data will be stored.
